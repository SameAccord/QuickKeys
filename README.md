# QuickKeys
QuickKeys is a background macro utility that automates login workflows and program launches via customizable keyboard shortcuts. Press a hotkey combination (e.g., Ctrl + F10) to instantly paste credentials, launch applications with auto-fill, or simply open programs. All usernames and passwords are stored with encryption for security.
Security Notice: QuickKeys is provided as-is for personal use. While credentials are encrypted, users should evaluate their own security requirements. Not recommended for high-security enterprise environments. Use at your own risk.
